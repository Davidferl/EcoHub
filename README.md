This is the _mostly_ unedited code that was produced during the competition

## Context

We had 24 hours to create a mobile app based on the theme "_Smart cities for a sustainable future_".

We envisioned a virtual assistant that analyzes your environmental impact in every aspect of your life: electricity consumption, transportation, and food. It suggests personalized actions that allow you to reduce your carbon footprint while saving time or money. Our application pulls data from several APIs (Hydro-Qu√©bec, CarbonInterface, Google Places API, etc.) and displays real-time data.

## Features

- Notifications
- Authentications
- Personalized recommendations
- Carbon footprint based on your car
- Real time city electricity consumption
- See nearby restaurants that have leftovers
- Multiple language support
